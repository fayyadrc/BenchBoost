## 🎯 Major Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Structure
**Initial Setup and Template Organization**

#### Template Restructuring
- **Split `index.html` into three specialized templates**:
  - `landing.html` - Marketing page with CTA buttons
  - `home.html` - Quick-start interface with question bubbles
  - `chat.html` - Full-featured chat interface
- **Fixed Flask template path configuration**:
  ```python
  app = Flask(__name__, template_folder='../templates')
  ```

### Phase 2: Modern UI Implementation
**Complete Interface Overhaul**

#### Chat Interface (`chat.html`)
- **Modern glassmorphism design** with Tailwind CSS
- **Collapsible sidebar** with settings panel
- **Theme management** (light/dark modes with persistence)
- **Auto-resizing input fields**
- **Message history** with proper formatting
- **Settings persistence** via localStorage
- **Responsive design** for mobile/desktop

#### Home Interface (`home.html`)
- **Quick question bubbles** for common FPL queries
- **Theme synchronization** with chat interface
- **localStorage message passing** to chat page
- **Smooth transitions** and hover effects

#### Landing Page (`landing.html`)
- **Professional marketing design**
- **Feature highlights** and call-to-action buttons
- **Consistent branding** across all pages

### Phase 3: Backend Intelligence
**FPL Data Integration and Query Processing**

#### Core Flask Application (`app.py`)
- **FPL API integration** with live data fetching
- **Intelligent query analysis** with keyword detection
- **Player search algorithms** with name normalization
- **Budget and position filtering** logic
- **Groq LLM integration** (Llama 3.1-8b-instant)
- **Error handling** and data validation

#### Query Processing Features
- **Player-specific queries**: "How much does Salah cost?"
- **Budget queries**: "Best defenders under £5m"
- **Position filtering**: "Top midfielders"
- **Performance analysis**: Player stats and form
- **Team information**: Squad analysis and recommendations

### Phase 4: Data Accuracy & Bug Fixes
**Quality Assurance and Issue Resolution**

#### Major Bug Fixes
1. **Kevin De Bruyne Issue Resolution**:
   - Fixed fake stats for non-Premier League players
   - Implemented strict data-only prompts
   - Enhanced data validation

2. **Query Detection Enhancement**:
   - Added price-related keywords: "cost", "costs", "price", "how much"
   - Improved player search reliability
   - Fixed budget query processing

3. **UI/UX Improvements**:
   - Sidebar collapse centering fix
   - Theme persistence across page navigation
   - Mobile responsiveness optimization

#### Data Validation (`test_fpl_data.py`)
- **Created diagnostic script** for FPL data accuracy
- **Verified 2025/26 season data** integrity
- **Confirmed pricing accuracy** (Salah £14.5m, Haaland £14.1m)

### Phase 5: RAG Implementation
**Retrieval-Augmented Generation Integration**

#### RAG System Development
- **Hybrid approach**: Rule-based queries + RAG fallback
- **Semantic search capability** for natural language queries
- **Knowledge base integration** for FPL rules and regulations
- **Team statistics aggregation** and search

#### RAG Components (`rag_helper.py`)
```python
class FPLRAGHelper:
    - Player indexing and searchable text generation
    - TF-IDF similarity calculation
    - Multi-type document handling (players, teams, rules)
    - Query classification and routing
    - Context formatting for LLM consumption
```

#### Knowledge Base (`fpl_knowledge.py`)
- **FPL rules and regulations** database
- **Scoring system** points breakdown
- **Team building constraints** and limits
- **Captain and chip mechanics**

### Phase 6: Advanced Query Handling
**Enhanced Capability and Coverage**

#### New Query Types Supported
1. **Rules & Knowledge Queries** (10 types):
   - Team composition limits
   - Scoring system mechanics
   - Transfer rules and penalties
   - Budget and pricing information

2. **Team Performance Queries** (3 types):
   - Team goal statistics
   - Defensive records
   - Clean sheet analysis

3. **Semantic Queries** (6+ patterns):
   - "Creative midfielder with good passing"
   - "Physical striker good in the air"
   - "Budget goalkeeper with good saves"

## 🧠 Technical Architecture

### Hybrid AI System
```
User Query
    ↓
Rule-Based Detection (Fast Path)
    ↓ (if no match)
RAG Knowledge Search
    ↓ (if no match)  
RAG Player/Team Search
    ↓
LLM Response Generation
```

### Data Flow
1. **FPL API** → Bootstrap data fetching
2. **Data Processing** → Player/team indexing
3. **Query Analysis** → Intent classification
4. **Context Retrieval** → Relevant data gathering
5. **LLM Generation** → Groq API response
6. **UI Rendering** → Formatted display

## 📊 System Capabilities
