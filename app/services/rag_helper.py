Assists in FPL:
• Any player who provides an assist gets {FPL_RULES_KNOWLEDGE['scoring_system']['assists']} points
• This applies to all positions (defenders, midfielders, forwards)
• Goalkeepers can theoretically get assists too (rare but possible)

Additional Scoring Info:
• Goals: GK/DEF = {FPL_RULES_KNOWLEDGE['scoring_system']['goals']['defender']} pts, MID = {FPL_RULES_KNOWLEDGE['scoring_system']['goals']['midfielder']} pts, FWD = {FPL_RULES_KNOWLEDGE['scoring_system']['goals']['forward']} pts

🃏 WILDCARD STRATEGY ADVICE

**When to Use Your Wildcard:**
• International breaks (time to plan)
• Major injury crisis in your team
• Fixture swing periods
• Early season (GW 3-6) team structure
• Before double gameweeks

**Things to Consider:**
• You get 2 wildcards per season
• First wildcard expires in January
• Don't panic-use after 1 bad week
• Plan for upcoming fixtures (3-4 GWs)
• Consider price rises/falls

**Current Timing:**
• Early season wildcards often effective
• Allows you to fix template issues
• Take advantage of early price rises
