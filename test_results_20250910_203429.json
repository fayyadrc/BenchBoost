Here's a comparison of the top 5 defenders:\n\n| Player | Price (\u00a3m) | Points | Form |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Calafiori | 5.6 | 28 | 9.3 |\n| J.Timber | 5.6 | 26 | 8.7 |\n| Gabriel | 6.1 | 14 | 4.7 |\n| Cash | 4.5 | 10 | 3.3 |\n| Mosquera | 5.4 | 3 | 1.0 |\n\n**Key Statistics:**\n\n- Calafiori has the highest form rating (9.3) among the top 5 defenders.\n- He has accumulated 28 points, which is the second-highest among the top 5.\n- His price of \u00a35.6m is relatively affordable compared to other top defenders.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nConsidering Calafiori's impressive form and points tally, he presents a strong differential option for FPL managers. His price and performance make him an attractive choice for those looking to strengthen their defensive line.",
